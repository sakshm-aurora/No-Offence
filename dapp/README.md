# Problem Statement
Using technology to bully is a problem that is on the rise which can lead 
to the decreased mental health of people. To tackle the problem of 
cyber-bullying and hate speech, the toxicity of the message being 
transported can be determined and used to decide whether a message is 
offensive or not. In case it is offensive, the user can ask his/her friends 
for a review to evaluate if it safe or not which can be done in the form 
of a voting system using decentralized application and block-chain.

# Solution
The proposed solution detects toxicity percentage of a comment and 
if it is more than 75% then it flags the same as toxic and sends the same
for a review to evaluate if it is safe or not using a blockchain based decentralized 
ethereum network for voting.
